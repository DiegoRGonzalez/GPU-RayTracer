Scene Construction
====================================================
First I planned out what initial primitives I would need. These were mostly boxes and I drew that out on a whiteboard in my room.

Once I did that I simply made those boxes at those coordinates. I had to adjust the height of my main tardis a little, but it was mostly alright.

Once I had this, I started working on the panels on the edges. I made two functions, addFourSides and subFourSides that would Add/subtract my primitives from my tardis on all four sides. This allowed me to work only on one side. 

I made flat boxes and cut six of them out of my main cube on each side.

Then I added my windows. This was done by first adding white panels to the top panels of my tardis. I then added thin stick-like cubes to my tardis at the correct positions.

Finally I made the top light by unioning a cylinder and a sphere.

Then I decided to fade my Tardis into existence. I did this by calculating two pixel colors, one where the Tardis is there and one where the Tardis isn't. Then I linearly interpolated between the two as a function of time.
This looked interesting, but I wanted to add some noise in to make it less uniform. After asking Jamie for help, I was able to add some noise into my Tardis materialization.
